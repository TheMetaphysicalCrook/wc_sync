__With the new file changes from Apple for iOS 11 and beta release of Pythonista, this project is no longer needed and is way more cumbesome than the built in tools. Use those.__

If you are using Pythonista 2.x you will need to change the PYTHONISTA_URL constant to `pythonista2://`.

## Installation

3. Go to Working Copy, Allow URL actions, and copy the URL key.

## Notes

Pythonista/Working Copy X-Callback URLs do not like spaces in the file/directory names (when cloning, fetching, pushing). Try to avoid any spaces when naming files and directories.
